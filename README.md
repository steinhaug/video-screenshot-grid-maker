# 1. Usage

## 1.1 How to use

Execute the vsgm.py file and it will ask you for a drive name, then you can select what folder to scan for video files.

    python vsgm.py

The script will scan the folder you chose and its subfolders for video files, and create screenshot grids with the same name.

## 1.2 Example grid

<img src="grid-example.jpg" alt="grid example" width="850"></img>
